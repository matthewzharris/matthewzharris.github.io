                    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I then performed business analysis of competitors in order to get a better sense of where they stood
                        in the market.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p2busanalysis.jpg" />
                    <p>From this research, I noted that their competitors all had:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimal Design</li>
                        <li>Brand Consistency</li>
                        <li>Mobile responsiveness</li>
                        <li>Good navigation</li>
                        <li>Listed all furniture online whether they had shipping or not</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When doing a feature comparison among the companies, Retrofit Home is lacking in a number of features.
                        For example, shown on the right is one of their competitor’s product pages, where I’ve highlight
                        features missing from Retrofit’s site including:</p>
                    <li>Search capabilities</li>
                    <li>User accounts</li>
                    <li>Product reviews</li>
                    <li>Large product photos</li>
                    <li>Detailed product descriptions</li>

                    <h3>Sitemap Analysis</h3>
                    <p>After visiting the business, I created a sitemap for Retrofit Home and noted several navigational issues
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The online shop is an uncategorized bucket of all their products</li>
                        <li>The shopping cart doesn’t appear until products are added</li>
                        <li>The gallery is just a bunch of external links</li>
                        <li>The lookbook looks unfinished and sends users to the online shop and contact page</li>
                        <li>The About Us is featured in their primary navigation although its unlikely used regularly</li>
                        <li>Their social media links are accessible only through the home page</li>
                    </ul>

                        Home’s redesign was Lauren based on her demographics, behaviors, and needs.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shoppers need a way to efficiently navigate Retrofit Home’s website because the current site is unstructured in a way that
                        impedes product discoverability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, shoppers need a way to create product reviews because reviews build confidence in purchase decisions.

                    <p>
                        Improve Retrofit Home’s website—through more intuitive navigation, creating a product review feature and streamlining the
                        checkout process—to achieve higher online sales and in-store traffic.

                    <p>
                        I ran a card sorting activity to have users categorize all of the products that Retrofit sells to fix their navigational
                        issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this activity, I was able to better categorize their products and begin work on a new website navigation.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p2cardsort.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        I created new product categories based on the activity associated with the product for the navigation, which helped created
                        a standard syntax for users.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the Utility Nav,</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I added an account functionality to the website to help Lauren have faster checkouts and leave product
                            reviews
                        </li>
                        <li>I also added search capabilities to help faster navigation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the Footer,</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I moved their secondary business info that wasn’t important to Lauren</li>
                        <li>And I added their social media links so they could be accessible from any page</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Initial Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        I drew up some initial sketches of the redesign to help determine layout and help solidify some of the page elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the home screen, I emphasized the new navigation and provide larger product photos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the product screens, I came up with early versions of the product category and product detail page layouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this, I learned that I needed to include more product summary and detail space because that was important to my persona.

                    <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
                    <p>
                        After initial sketches, I drew up some more in depth paper prototypes to work out some the interactive elements like the
                        cart function and checkout process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From working on this, I realized that it would be better for Lauren to have the product review section higher up in the layout
                        due to its importance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also decided from testing this that I wanted the checkout form to have better indicators of progress for the user.

                    <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>On the product page, I responded to Lauren’s pain points by featuring multiple, large product images,
                        detailed product descriptions, and product recommendations.</p>
                    <p>The other major element added was the product review feature. The product review flow begins on the product
                        detail page where users were able to click Write a Review which is underlined for the user to know
                        it’s a hyperlink. Clicking the hyperlink would then open a product review modal right below. The
                        user can then enter a star rating, title and a review for the product. After clicking Post Review….The
                        user would receive a message letting them know that their review would then be added.</p>

                    <p>In the checkout flow, after Lauren added a product to her cart, a modal would slide down from the header
                        notifying her that the item was added to her cart. The option to checkout would be immediate and
                        would be colored to draw attention to the action. After clicking Checkout Now, she would be brought
                        to the shipping information page. The progress indicator would help assure where she is in the process
                        and action buttons would be easily clickable for her. She would move to the updated payment page,
                        click Review & Confirm when she entered her payment details. And finally on this page she could review
                        her order details before confirming the payment.</p>
