        <h4>Commitment to Users</h4>
        <p>
          I appreciate Amazonâ€™s obsessive customer focus. For me, UX design is
          that obsession put into practice to deliver the best experience bar
          none.

        <h4>Bias for Action</h4>
        <p>
          As a designer with a background in business, Iâ€™m inclined to stand up
          and take action in any team. I believe that action delivers results
          and iteration on those results helps create success.

        <h4>Invent and Simplify</h4>
        <p>
          When designing, I use research to develop as many features as possible
          to meet and exceed user needs. Filtering those features into an MVP
          that is still innovative is an exciting process for me.
