        <h4>Passion for Microsoft</h4>
        <p>
          As a tech enthusiast, I am extremely excited by the culture of design
          and forward thinking strategy of Microsoft. My values of innovation
          and hunger for success align with what Microsoft delivers to its
          customers across its products.

        <h4>Design Narrative</h4>
        <p>
          My strength lies in communicating design, advocating for users while
          framing it in terms of broader business goals.

        <h4>Business Software</h4>
        <p>
          Having worked in technology consulting, I am painfully aware of the
          neglect business users often feel. I have a personal goal to make
          business software just as beautiful and easy to use as consumer
          products.
