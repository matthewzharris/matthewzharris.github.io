    <p>
      From my experience, the most important aspect of this project was
      balancing the users' needs with client asks. My approach was use market
      and user research as early and often as possible to ensure that our
      approach was based on data. As a result, I feel that Cue is a valuable app
      that could benefit people looking to create casual events.
