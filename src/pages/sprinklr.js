      brief="During the summer wildfires in Washington state, I became concerned for my family and puppy that the indoor air quality was no longer safe. Instead of buying an air purifier, I wanted to know if I could find plants that would help clean indoor air year round. The major issue that I found was my black thumb; Iâ€™ve always had issues picking plants and keeping them alive. I wanted to explore the issue of starting to grow plants and make it easier for beginner gardeners."
