          <p>
            At the beginning of 2019, New Engen had a design system that was
            failing our product and engineering teams. The design system as it
            stood had a number of issues:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design system was siloed in a designer-owned Sketch file</li>
            <li>No centralized implementation existed in the web front end</li>
            <li>
              Patterns and components weren't being reused on either the design
              or development side
            </li>
            <li>No process to add or audit the design system existed</li>
            <li>
              No "source of truth" led to incosistent application of standards
            </li>
          </ul>
        </SubSection>
        <hr />
        <SubSection title="Solution Overview">
          <p>
            The scope of the challenges that existed in the existing design
            system made it clear that an iterative approach wouldn't be
            sufficientâ€“we needed to rethink the system from the ground up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing this, I proposed a three part solution and aligned the
            team including the director of UX and VP of engineering behind it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Conduct internal and external <strong>research</strong> to arrive
              at a set of guiding principles
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement a set of <strong>process improvements</strong> to ensure
              the team and the system stays in sync
            </li>
            <li>
              Work collaboratively to implement a initial version of{' '}
              <strong>the system</strong> that we could continue to build on
            </li>
