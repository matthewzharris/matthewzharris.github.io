      impact="During this client project, I was the lead on information architecture, interaction design and visual design. I led the business analysis research in terms of heuristic analysis of the current product, comparative analysis, and feature comparison in the market. I led the initial sketches, led a design studio, developed the current and future state sitemaps, user flows, low and high fidelity prototypes. I also redesigned the Cue branding for the project."
      problem="The current process for Seattle residents to recycle can be onerous, which leads residents to throw items into the garbage instead of properly recycling them."
      goal="To make the recycling process for Seattle residents easy so that we can help reduce our waste as a part of our cityâ€™s Zero Waste Strategy, in which we are aiming to recycle 70% of our waste by 2022."
