                        During this concept project, I was lead in information architecture and visual design as well as the project manager of our
                        UX design team. I did the business research of the project through a comparative analysis of features
                        in the disaster app market and a heuristic analysis of top apps. I created the current sitemap and
                        mobile sitemap, hi fidelity prototypes, and the Ready Seattle branding. I also lead the presentation
                        of design solutions.</p>

                    <p>We evaluated the current website in order to determine what information would be pertinent for our app.
                        I created the sitemap of the current website so that we could understand how Seattle Emergency Management
                        organizes their content and how they lay out information to the user. The information on the site
                        was very dense and split into many different categories based on whether the user was an individual,
                        school official, or business owner. The amount of information was pretty overwhelming but we decided
                        to focus on the individual since this would be for a personal mobile application.

                    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I lead the comparative analysis of disaster prep apps in the market so that we could review potential
                        features. Although FEMA and Red Cross had the most to offer to a user, they were incredibly bloated
                        in features and made preparing for an emergency a daunting task. Ready NYC was a better example of
                        helping a city’s residents get prepared and provide information during an emergency, but it only
                        provided information for NYC and had some major design issues.

                    <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
                    <p>We did a full heuristic evaluation on Ready NYC because it was the best conveyer of a citywide emergency
                        preparedness mobile app. We found that the app was strong in facilitating user tasks, had great readability
                        and information architecture. The app struggled with unclear labeling, inconsistent design/branding
                        and providing context for the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>The app was good at:</p>

                        persona that we would design the new Seattle Emergency Management mobile app for. Jake embodied a
                        lot of the feelings that people we interviewed had about emergency preparedness. He had heard that
                        there may be a major natural disaster in Seattle (especially an earthquake), but hasn’t experience
                        any disaster himself. He knows he needs to prepare but is unsure of how to do so and thinks it may
                        be a daunting task.

                        page and a map of disasters and shelters. In order to help Jake prepare for a disaster, we created

                    <p>
                        As lead information architect, I wanted to focus on having as few screens as possible and focus on responding to the needs
                        of the persona and our client. While the current website had a lot of information, not all of it
                        was pertinent to disaster preparation and made little sense to include in a mobile app. In the sitemap
                        visual, you can see the first and last iteration of the mobile app information architecture. There
                        are a few major changes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The settings page was moved from the Navigation bar to the Tab bar due to the fact it was found
                                to be confusing whether it was page specific or universal to users</li>
                            <li>After paper prototype testing, we standardized the terminology to “Go Bag” for the disaster preparation
                                checklist. This also had bearing on the visual design as well.

                            <li>The map was simplified to remove filters after paper prototype testing. The filters weren’t important
                                to our persona and caused confusion to our users.

                            <li>The Info page was renamed to Resources and the section was recategorized to remove the separate

                    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the brand of Seattle Emergency Management doesn’t really exist in any sense of colors, iconography or consistent
                        imagery so I started from scratch when creating the ReadySeattle brand.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the lead in visual design, I began by researching Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) to ensure
                        that the app design aligned with iOS standards. From the HIG, I determined that we should use the
                        iOS system font family of San Francisco which focused on readability and scannability; this was important
                        in our comparative analysis and something we wanted to include our app.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the primary logo, I was inspired by a disaster preparation infographic from our client of an emergency
                        bag. After some research, I found out that the emergency go bag was a well known image of emergency
                        readiness, which was fitting for our primary logo. I created some secondary logos sans the icon to
                        be used in the app and by our client. The iconography was influenced by some icons that our client
                        had used in the past but was updated with our ReadySeattle brand. The color palette was chosen by
                        researching earthquake alert colors and then choosing slightly brighter shades to be appealing to
                        users.
                    </p>

                    <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>
                        With our style guide complete, I created our loading screen and emergency alert notification modal. For usability tests,
                        we went through 3 major flows through the app.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3introscreens.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        After entering, the user lands immediately on the Alerts page where view alerts and the time it was issued. To respond to
                        user feedback, arrows let users know its clickable to see additional alert details. They can click
                        the hyperlink I created to see the alert on the map. In response to users, I created a legend on
                        the map to provide context for the pins.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3alertflow.jpeg" />
                    <p>
                        The Go Bag flow is where users collect materials for emergencies. Here, I added a description of the Go Bag to help inform
                        our users of its meaning. I also provided them with a responsive visualization as they added items
                        to their Go Bag as the bag is filled it will look more like the final app logo.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3gobagflow.jpeg" />
                    <p>For the final flow about emergency resources, I renamed the “Info” page to “Resources” based on where
                        users were navigating for natural disaster information.</p>

                    <p>We received the following final usability test findings:</p>

                        <li>Users expected a back button on Go Bag and Alert screens</li>
                        <li>Upon first visit, the Show Current Bag button should be grayed out</li>
                        <li>Alerts in feed need to be more specific in title</li>
                        <li>Visualize disasters on map as shaded regions</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication across team members is mission critical. Any insight lost from researcher to final
                            visual designer is a lost opportunity to respond to users.</li>
                        <li>Gathering initial user research from differing demographics is crucial because those things will
                            influence your persona and final design</li>
                        <li>Testing with users is incredibly important because their responses to your design is almost always
                            met differently than expected</li>
