                        During this concept project, I was lead in information architecture and visual design as well as the project manager of our
                        UX design team. I did the business research of the project through a comparative analysis of features
                        in the disaster app market and a heuristic analysis of top apps. I created the current sitemap and
                        mobile sitemap, hi fidelity prototypes, and the Ready Seattle branding. I also created and lead the
                        presentation of design solutions.</p>

                    <p>I evaluated the current website in order to determine what information would be pertinent for our app.
                        I created the sitemap of the current website to understand how Seattle Emergency Management organizes
                        their content and how they lay out information to the user. The information on the site was very
                        dense and split into many different categories based on whether the user was an individual, school
                        official, or business owner. The amount of information was pretty overwhelming so I decided to focus
                        on the preparing individual section since the app would be for Seattle residents' personal usage.

                    <p>I lead the comparative analysis of disaster prep apps in the market to review potential features for
                        the app. Although FEMA and Red Cross had the most to offer to a user, they were incredibly bloated
                        in features and made preparing for an emergency a daunting task. Ready NYC was a better example of
                        helping a city’s residents get prepared and provide information during an emergency, but it only
                        provided information for NYC and had some design issues.

                    <p>I did a full heuristic evaluation on Ready NYC because it was the best representation of a citywide emergency
                        preparedness mobile app. I found that the app was strong in facilitating user tasks, great readability
                        and information architecture. The app struggled with unclear labeling and inconsistent design.

                        mobile app for. Jake embodied a lot of the feelings that people we interviewed had about emergency
                        preparedness. He had heard that there may be a major natural disaster in Seattle (especially an earthquake),
                        but hadn't experienced any disaster himself. He knows he needs to prepare but is unsure of how to
                        do so and thinks it is a daunting task.

                        and a map of disasters and shelters. In order to help Jake prepare for a disaster, we created an
                        emergency go bag checklist. I created a sitemap in order to organize the information that would be

                        As lead information architect, I wanted to focus on having as few screens as possible and focus on responding to the needs
                        of the persona and our client. While the current website had a lot of information, not all of it
                        was pertinent to disaster preparation and made little sense to include in a mobile app. In the sitemap
                        visual, you can see the last iteration of the mobile app information architecture. There are a few
                        major changes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Settings was moved from the Navigation bar to the Tab bar due to the fact it was found to be
                                confusing whether it was page-specific or universal.</li>
                            <li>I standardized the terminology to “Go Bag” for the disaster preparation checklist screen. This
                                also had bearing on the visual design as well.
                            </li>
                            <li>The map was simplified to remove filters after paper prototype testing since they weren't important
                                to our persona and caused confusion to users.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Info screen was renamed to Resources and the section was recategorized to remove the separate
                                Resources dropdown.

                    <p>
                        Currently, the brand of Seattle Emergency Management doesn’t really exist in any sense of colors, iconography or consistent
                        imagery so I started from scratch when creating the ReadySeattle brand. As the lead in visual design,
                        I began by researching Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) to ensure that the app design aligned
                        with iOS standards.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3styleguide.jpg" />
                    <p>For the primary logo, I was inspired by a disaster preparation infographic from our client of an emergency
                        bag. After some research, I found out that the emergency go bag was a universal image of emergency
                        readiness, which was fitting for our app vision. I created some secondary logos sans the icon to
                        be used in the app and by our client. The color palette was chosen by researching earthquake alert
                        colors and then choosing slightly brighter, happier shades to be appealing to users. From the HIG,
                        I determined that we should use the iOS system font family of San Francisco which focused on readability
                        and scannability (important factors from our comparative analysis). The iconography was influenced
                        by some icons that our client had used in the past but was updated with our ReadySeattle brand colors.

                    <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>
                        With our style guide complete, I created our loading screen and emergency alert notification screen for when a user first
                        enter the app. For usability tests, we went through 3 major flows through the app.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3introscreens.jpeg" />
                    <p>
                        After entering, the user lands immediately on the Alerts page where they can view alerts and the time they were issued. To
                        respond to user feedback, arrows let users know its clickable to see additional alert details. They
                        can click the hyperlink I created to see the alert on the map. In response to users, I created a
                        legend on the map to provide context for the pins.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img" src="./images/p3alertflow.jpeg" />
                    <p>
                        The Go Bag flow is where users collect materials for emergencies. Here, I added a description of the Go Bag to help inform
                        our users of its meaning. I also provided them with a responsive visualization as they added items
                        to their Go Bag as the bag is filled it will look more like the final app logo.

                    <p>For the final flow about emergency resources, I renamed the “Info” screen to “Resources” based on where
                        users were navigating for natural disaster information.</p>

                        <li>Users expected a back button on Go Bag and Alert screens</li>
                        <li>Upon first visit, the Show Current Bag button should be grayed out</li>
                        <li>Alert titles in feed need to be more specific</li>
                        <li>Visualize disasters on map as shaded regions</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication across team members is mission critical. Any insight lost from researcher to final
                            visual designer is a lost opportunity to respond to users.</li>
                        <li>Gathering initial user research from differing demographics is crucial because those things will
                            influence your persona and final design.</li>
                        <li>Testing with users is incredibly important because their responses to your design is almost always
                            met differently than expected.</li>
