                        UX design team. I did the business research of the project through a comparative analysis of features
                        in the disaster app market and a heuristic analysis of top apps. I created the current sitemap and
                        mobile sitemap, hi fidelity prototypes, and the Ready Seattle branding. I also lead the presentation
                        of design solutions.</p>

                        kits for both him and his girlfriend.

                    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since ReadySeattle didn’t previously exist, I started from scratch to create a brand. For the primary logo, I was inspired
                        by a disaster prep infographic of an emergency bag from our client. The go bag is a universal image
                        of emergency readiness which was fitting for our app vision. The color palette was chosen by researching
                        earthquake alert colors and then choosing slightly brighter shades to be appealing to users. Readability
                        was a big factor so I used Apple’s San Francisco typeface based on their Human Interface Guidelines
                        (HIG). The iconography for the Go Bag items was influenced by icons from our client but were updated
                        with the ReadySeattle colors.The navigation icons were designed with simplicity in mind to help the
                        go bag icons stand out on the screen.

                    <p>
                        With our style guide complete, I created our loading screen and emergency alert notification modal. For usability tests,
                        we went through 3 major flows through the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After entering, the user lands immediately on the Alerts page where view alerts and the time it was issued. To respond to
                        user feedback, arrows let users know its clickable to see additional alert details. They can click
                        the hyperlink I created to see the alert on the map. In response to users, I created a legend on
                        the map to provide context for the pins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Go Bag flow is where users collect materials for emergencies. Here, I added a description of the Go Bag to help inform
                        our users of its meaning. I also provided them with a responsive visualization as they added items
                        to their Go Bag as the bag is filled it will look more like the final app logo.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the final flow about emergency resources, I renamed the “Info” page to “Resources” based on where
                        users were navigating for natural disaster information.</p>

                    <h3>Testing Results</h3>
                    <p>We received the following final usability test findings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users expected a back button on Go Bag and Alert screens</li>
                        <li>Upon first visit, the Show Current Bag button should be grayed out</li>
                        <li>Alerts in feed need to be more specific in title</li>
                        <li>Visualize disasters on map as shaded regions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication across team members is mission critical. Any insight lost from researcher to final
                            visual designer is a lost opportunity to respond to users.</li>
                        <li>Gathering initial user research from differing demographics is crucial because those things will
                            influence your persona and final design</li>
                        <li>Testing with users is incredibly important because their responses to your design is almost always
                            met differently than expected</li>
                    </ul>
