                        During this client project, I was the lead on information architecture, interaction design and visual design. I led the business
                        analysis research in terms of heuristic analysis of the current product, comparative analysis, and
                        feature comparison in the market. I led the initial sketches, led a design studio, developed the
                        current and future state sitemaps, user flows, low and high fidelity prototypes. I also redesigned
                        the Cue branding for the project.</p>

                    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I led our business analysis research of the event mobile app market to see where there might be opportunities
                        for Cue.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For informal events, texts and group texts were used to create events, even though there were
                                significant issues with group texts like non-responses, general confusion with no specific
                                place for event details, etc. </li>
                            <li>For formal events, people typically use a calendar app to schedule meetings (more for work environments)
                                and used Facebook events for more formal scheduled events with friends.</li>
                        </ul>
                        From this analysis, we determined that their might be an opportunity to help create informal events with more structure than
                        texting.

                    <p>
                        From research, we created Jill Smith who is a busy working mom with packed work and family schedules, but she still tries
                        to see her friends whenever they have free time. She hates when people are late, getting e-vites,
                        and being the go-between for events. Her pain points with events are that she and her friends often
                        forget to meet when they planned because of their busy lives. They also often need to change when
                        and where they planned to meet and coordinate between multiple friends. With Jill in mind, we created
                        our problem to design for.

                    <p>
                        After creating a list of features to respond to Jill, we used the MoSCoW method to come up with the following feature prioritization
                        that helped to define our vision for Cue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After initial sketches, I led a design studio to brainstorm the flow of information and interface of our features. I wanted
                        to explore how to be “chat first” (something that the client saw as important) while maintaining
                        the primary focus on creating/managing events.

                        to help simplify the information architecture. I went back to the standard + sign in the bottom corner
                        for the easy event creation for Jill. I included an Archive of past events to help our persona create
                        events from past groups.

                    <p>For the event chat flow, the major update was the streamlined user flow for a 1 click to land into the
                        chat. I also included the ability to accept the invite from the specific event screen.</p>

                    <p>For the ETA flow, I created a simple dialog box when setting up the app to explain what the feature is
                        and ease privacy concerns. With the new Auto ETA, I wanted the ability for users to change that setting
                        to be on/off as well as change the amount of time before it would allow ETA to be shared. In the
                        event details, I included an ETA opt out at the request of our client.</p>

                    <p>
                        For the Cue brand, I created a style guide by researching Material Design standards since my client requested an Android-first
                        design. For the primary logo, I wanted to continue to invoke the idea of events and chatting while
                        incorporating more of the Cue brand. So I created a chat bubble from the C in Cue’s secondary logo
                        and added a calendar icon. For the color palette, I updated the green theme from our client but used
                        a much lighter shade to help grab users attention. I found a bright blue color for a secondary color
                        using Material Design’s recommended palettes. Following those standards, I chose the Android Roboto
                        typeface and iconography for the app.

                        With the style guide complete, I applied the designs to the new Cue app. I started with the sign in process that our client
                        wanted to see with the brand treatment.
                    </p>
                    <img class="work-img " src="./images/p4signin.jpg" />
                    <p>After that, I created the permissions screens for contacts, location and send/receive text messages.
                        Underneath the permission, I included the reason the permission was necessary and included a progress
                        indicator for how many permissions the user has left. The language in the Location permission was
                        updated to clarify ETA acronym confusion.</p>
                    <img class="work-img " src="./images/p4permissions.jpg" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the high fidelity prototype, I used the secondary blue color for any clickable buttons and links throughout the app.
                        In response to usability testing, I used a History instead of an Archive icon and used a notifications
                        bell icon. In the third event screen, I added the See Event action so that it was obvious that they
                        were clickable. I also included quick information about the event to help Jill get those details
                        quickly. In the final screen, I added feedback for the user that the event has been created.

                    <p>
                        In the Event Chat flow, a user clicks “See Event” to navigate to the specific event. There, the user can accept events and
                        chat with attendees.

                    <img class="work-img " src="./images/p4finaleventchatflow.jpg" />
                    <p>For the Auto-ETA feature, users are able to update it globally in their Settings, including the length
                        of time shared prior. In the event details page, they can also turn it off locally per event.</p>

                    <h3>Usability Findings</h3>
                    <p>We received the following final usability test findings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Participants unable to invite attendees</strong> - In response to our client’s usability, I created
                            an ability for participants to be able to invite other people on the event creation screen.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Developer feedback</strong> - Our client also wanted the ability for users to be able to leave
                            feedback for the developer. Clicking the hyperlink would send them to their mail client to email
                            the company email address.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Unable to know who created event or see event attendance status</strong> - Our researcher conducted
                            2 high-fidelity usability tests. We received some usability feedback about wanting more event
                            data in the card so I updated the card to show who created the event as well as whether you accepted
                            the event.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ETA language confusing</strong> - The ETA language was confusing in event details since it is
                            a double negative. I updated to be a straightforward On/Off toggle.</li>
                    </ul>

                            client.
                        </li>
                        <li>I’d also want to review potential features that were identified as persona and client needs including:
                            calendar app integration, mobile website preview of Cue event, text updates for non Cue users</li>
