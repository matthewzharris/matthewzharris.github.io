                        During this client project, I was the lead on information architecture, interaction design and visual design. I led the business
                        analysis research in terms of heuristic analysis of the current product, comparative analysis, and
                        feature comparison in the market. I led the initial sketches, led a design studio, developed the
                        current and future state sitemaps, user flows, low and high fidelity prototypes. I also redesigned
                        the Cue branding for the project.</p>

                    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I led our business analysis research of the event mobile app market to see where there might be opportunities
                        for Cue.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For informal events, texting was primarliy used to create events, even though there were significant
                                issues with group texts like non-responses, general confusion with no specific place for
                                event details, etc. </li>
                            <li>For formal events, people typically used a calendar app to schedule meetings and used Facebook
                                events for more formal scheduled events with friends.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>From this analysis, we determined that their might be an opportunity to help people create informal events
                        with more structure than texting.

                        From research, we created Jill Smith who is a busy working mom with packed work and family schedules, but she still tries
                        to see her friends whenever they have free time. She hates when people are late, getting e-vites,
                        and being the go-between for events. Her pain points with events are that she and her friends often
                        forget to meet when they planned because of their busy lives. They also often need to change when
                        and where they planned to meet and coordinate between multiple friends.

                    <p>
                        After creating a list of features to respond to our research, we used the MoSCoW method to prioritize features that helped
                        define our Cue's vision.

                    <p>
                        After initial sketches, I led a design studio to explore the flow of information and interface of our features. I wanted
                        to explore how to be “chat first” (something that the client saw as important) while maintaining
                        the primary focus on creating/managing events.

                    <p>On the home screen, I removed the tab bar and replaced it with a filter for scheduled/unscheduled events
                        to help simplify the information architecture. I went back to the standard + sign in the bottom corner
                        for the easy event creation for Jill. I included an Archive of past events to help our persona create
                        events from past groups.

                    <p>For the event chat flow, the major update was the streamlined user flow for a 1 click to land into the
                        chat. I also included the ability to accept the invite from the specific event screen.</p>
                    <img class="work-img " src="./images/p4eventchatflow.jpg" />
                    <p>For the ETA flow, I created a simple dialog box when setting up the app to explain what the feature is
                        and ease privacy concerns. With the new Auto ETA, I wanted the ability for users to change that setting
                        to be on/off as well as change the amount of time before it would allow ETA to be shared. In the
                        event details, I included an ETA opt out at the request of our client.</p>

                    <p>
                        For the Cue brand, I created a style guide by researching Material Design standards since my client requested an Android-first
                        design. For the primary logo, I wanted to invoke the idea of events and chatting so I created a chat
                        bubble from the C in Cue’s secondary logo and added a calendar icon. For the color palette, I updated
                        the green color from our client and found a bright blue color for a secondary color for a brighter,
                        modern look. I chose to use standard Android Roboto typeface and iconography for the app.

                    <p>
                        With the style guide complete, I applied the designs to the the sign in process that our client wanted with the new branding.

                    <img class="work-img " src="./images/p4signin.jpg" />
                    <p>After that, I created the permissions screens for contacts, location and send/receive text messages.
                        Underneath the permission, I included the reason the permission was necessary and included a progress
                        indicator for how many permissions the user has left. The language in the Location permission was
                        updated to clarify ETA acronym confusion.</p>

                        For the high fidelity prototype, I used the secondary blue color for any clickable buttons and links throughout the app.
                        In response to usability testing, I used a History instead of an Archive icon and used a notifications
                        bell icon. In the third event screen, I added the See Event action so that it was obvious that they
                        were clickable. I also included quick information about the event to help Jill get those details
                        quickly. In the final screen, I added feedback for the user that the event has been created.

                        In the Event Chat flow, a user clicks “See Event” to navigate to the specific event, where the user can accept events and
                        chat with attendees.

                        locally per event in the Event Details screen.</p>

                    <h3>Usability Findings</h3>
                    <p>We received the following final usability test findings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Participants unable to invite attendees</strong> - I created a toggle for event creators to allow
                            participants to invite on the New Event screen.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Developer feedback</strong> - I created a clickable hyperlink that would allow users to send
                            app feedback.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Unable to know who created event or see event attendance status</strong> - I updated the event
                            cards to show users who created the event and who accepted the event invite.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ETA language confusing</strong> - I updated the ETA language on the toggle to be a straightforward
                            for users.</li>

                        <li>Due to a short timeline, I would continue usability testing of the prototype and review results with
                            the client.
                        </li>
                        <li>I’d want to review potential features that were identified as persona needs including: calendar app
                            integration, mobile website preview of Cue event, text updates for non Cue users</li>
