                        During this hackathon project, I took the lead as project manager after coming up with the idea that we selected. I led the
                        UX team in terms of information architecture, interaction design, visual design. I created the initial
                        sketches and low fidelity wireframes for our developers. I also created the Emerald Seattle branding
                        and presented the MVP for the mayor’s office of Seattle.</p>

                    <p>We did an informational interview with one person in Seattle that had experience with wanting to recycle
                        different items from their home. We gathered their pain points and quickly created a proto-persona
                        to design for.</p>

                            <strong>Context Scenario:</strong> Steve Jones lives with his family in Ballard that he bought a few
                            years ago. They regularly maintain and enjoy “spring cleaning” a couple of times a year, which
                            can produce a lot of items for recycling. John wants to be able to recycle his household items
                            in an environmentally friendly way, but doesn’t know how to find that information easily</p>

                        <p>
                            The current process for Seattle residents to recycle can be onerous, which leads residents to throw items into the garbage
                            instead of properly recycling them.

                            To make the recycling process for Seattle residents easy so that we can help reduce our waste as a part of our city’s Zero
                            Waste Strategy, in which we are aiming to recycle 70% of our waste by 2022.

                    <p>
                        To respond to Steve’s pain points, I created our first sketches of what our app would look like and focused on the recycling
                        guide for our users. I wanted to build an easy decision tree that would lead the user to the closest
                        recycling center that handled the item they were looking to recycle. I quickly tested this with users
                        and handed the design over to our dev team to start work.

                    <p>I developed a quick style guide that included the design for our logo and secondary logo. I wanted to
                        use trees in the logo to tie to the “emerald city” of Seattle as well as the recycling sign to help
                        inform our users. The secondary logo was made for presentation purposes. For the typography and style
                        of the app, our developers were most comfortable with Material Design so I followed those standards
                        for visual elements.

                    <h3>Prototype</h3>
                    <p>With a prototype developed by our software engineers, I created a major task flow that would be completed
                        by a user and used in our presentaiton. The user would land on our homepage that describes our mission.
                        Then, the user would go to Guide page where they will be walked through how to recycle the item.
                        From there, they click into the categories I created and select the specific item. They are then
                        given a location entry form and provided with all the recycling centers that they can go to listed
                        by distance from their location. Finally, clicking into the recycler provides the full details including
                        restrictions and fees (if any) that they need to recycle.</p>
